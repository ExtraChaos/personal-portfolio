			<h2>Brief & Role</h2>
			<p>
				In the first term of my final year, I was required to secure an industry-relevant placement. For this, I acquired a brief from RaRa games to help create assets for a new co-op title. The general brief outline I received from RaRa games was a co-op game called Slackers. The primary concept of this game revolves around evil aliens infiltrating Human society with the intent to destabilise through their sabotage. Players take on the role of the Infiltrators, and it is their mission to cause as much havoc within the work environment as possible through deliberately inefficient, absurd and convoluted means, all while not getting found out by the Humans. The game is meant to be a wacky, silly experience, akin to the show Invader Zim if the titular protagonist were working retail to destroy Human society as an undercover alien agent. 
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<p>
				My role for this project was as a Game artist with my primary focus on character concept art and development. In this role, I would formulate ideas for what the alien infiltrators could look like and what role they could fill, what the Human characters/NPCs would look like and any special characters (such as an antagonist character for the aliens to evade). Lastly, figure out what kind of environment these characters would find themselves in, create concept art for these ideas and ultimately 3D models for them. 
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<p>
				Although I wasn’t given a specific brief relating to character design, I had negotiated with the client to place a focus on character concept & design. The generalised nature of the brief meant an absence of specificity in requirements. This meant much more flexibility and freedom in the direction I could approach the project. At the same time, this required a degree of interpretation with a focus on visual ideation. This meant the project focused heavily on concept art to remain generally consistent with the brief.
			</p>
				<br>
			</div>
			<div class="year2container">
			<h2>Pre-Production</h2>
			<p>
			As this would be a solo project, I maintained what I believed was a reasonable scope. As such, production would be focused on creating the minimum amount of work required to clearly communicate the ideas of the project. Keeping the focus simple, I narrowed down the work to these two overarching goals:
			<br>
			-	Designing an Alien Infiltrator character.
			<br>	
			-	Designing a Human character.
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<p>
			This would involve a standard alien infiltrator character which would serve as the player model for the game, and a Human antagonist character actively attempting to thwart the Alien scheme which the players must avoid. The idea was that everything else that came afterward would work to inform these two objectives. In addition, as my work would be developed in isolation, I came up with gameplay ideas alongside my character concepts that may or may not be a part of the final game, but that I thought would be fitting in Slackers.	
			</p>	
			<h3></h3>
			<p>
			There were three significant challenges which shaped pre-production. The immediate challenge of this project was the lack of groundwork beyond the basic information from the brief and discussions with the client through which the foundational ideas had to be built upon. Secondly, as mentioned prior, the project would be solo operation, meaning the work had to exist in isolation without being able to fit into an existing environment. Lastly, as the project would be tackled later in the academic timeline, there was less time to contribute to the project.	
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<p>
			In previous projects, I usually approached with a fluid angle without any sort of management platform. For this project, I adopted the tool Trello, which is a simple to use platform that utilises Kanban-styled boards with lists and cards. By doing this, it mitigates the risk of losing track of project assets and progress, whilst also encouraging prioritisation. Trello can be used to break down projects into smaller segments, identifying what tasks are manageable and what tasks could be either discarded or left as optional goals. This was done to prevent scope-creep. Using Trello, I created a basic list of 4 cards to divide up my work into manageable and achievable tasks/ideas.

			<h1>Core Conceptualisation</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="year2container">
				<h3>Role of Concept Art</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					As a game artist, concept art is the first step in setting a visual direction and a tool for clarifying my creative vision. Concept art allows for rapid exploration of ideas and a quick avenue for iteration, while also serving to articulate creative intent for both the client and the artist. Given the lack of an art specific brief and the lack of an existing foundation for the game, this project gave me plenty of flexibility in the direction which I could go. To ground my ideas, my sketches focused on distinguishing Aliens from Human characters in a direction that would support the comedic aspects of the concept.
				</p>
				<h3></h3>				
				<h3>Art Style</h3>
				<br>				
				<p>
					As the game would be a very humour-driven experience with a focus on the absurdity of the scenario, I decided on a simplistic art style for the characters. This placed a focus on exaggerating proportions for the characters, such as larger heads and wider eyes, which also supports readability in gameplay as each character would sport unique silhouettes that stand out amongst a busy game environment with multiple players. A simplified art style means that unique or bizarre features do not look odd and jarring on an already absurd character design. Additionally, with the solo development in mind, a simplistic art style was also an appropriate choice as designs could be easily iterated upon as compared to more complicated art styles. 
				</p>
				</div>
			<div class="year2container">				
				<h3>Alien Characters</h3>
				<p>
				My first goal was to create some basic Alien concept pieces. As player characters and outer space creatures, the aliens needed to be obvious and stand out amongst the Humans. Importantly, this meant figuring out how to translate aliens into disguised workers such as they could fit into a mundane workplace environment. An example of this is how to design bodies that could fit in uniforms that may be too small, too big, too short or too long for their anatomy, adding to the visual absurdity of the scenarios they find themselves in. At the same time, these alien designs must be viable from a gameplay standpoint, such as having limbs that could interact with the environment without being too over-the-top. Therefore, when conceptualising the alien design, I created a brief list of criteria of essential design concepts the Aliens had to roughly (But not always) obey:
				</p>
				<h3></h3>
				<p>
				-	They must obey a vaguely Humanoid silhouette with their infiltration attire (Business suits, restaurant workers, etc) to sell the illusion that they fit in the workplace they are infiltrating.
				<br>
				-	Their limbs must be able to fit their Human-designed attire or find creative ways to fit into them.
				<br>
				-	They must look charming instead of nightmarish. As the game is meant to be cartoony and absurd, a charming or cute design elevate the comedic factor by presenting the terrifying evil infiltrators as intentionally unintimidating.
				</p>
				<h3></h3>
				<p>
				Based on these criteria, I gathered a moodboard of several alien/monster/animal characters roughly fitting the criteria to use as a base for inspiration. 	
				</p>
				<img src="SlackerMoodboard.png">
				<p>
				A prominent inspiration was Octodad, titular character of the game Octodad, with his lanky octopus’ limbs disguised as arms and legs. The character’s use of his tentacles as limbs to mimic arms and legs would be interesting to see in a busy retail environment, especially if they were flailing about hitting objects on accident (or on purpose). Another source of inspiration is the Mudokons, the suit-wearing antagonists of the Oddworld franchise. They stood out to me as not only being suit-wearing aliens with completely different bodies beneath, but also for unique use of hands as their legs (with their actual legs being small), resulting in very wobbly movement in the games.	
				</p>
				<h3></h3>
				<p>
				With the inspiration in mind, multiple concepts of the alien infiltrator bodies were created. Although I initially thought of the aliens all sharing a single customisable appearance but with unique colours, I decided instead that multiple unique aliens with their own special mechanics would make for more varied gameplay.	
				</p>
				<h3></h3>
				<img src="ConceptAlienOne.png">				
				<p>
				The first alien character is a mix of the traditional grey alien with the Octodad limbs. This character is meant to be a scout/lookout, its four eyes mean that important objects are highlighted for this character. It was with this character that I had to decide between a smoother outline or a blockier outline, ultimately favouring the blockier outline as the sharper silhouette would fit a more sinister nature. It is at this point I decided that, apart from the short infiltrator, the aliens should have a thinner body shape in general but have comically large heads that juxtapose with the body. Multiple tentacle limbs which could interact with/hold on to multiple objects simultaneously, or grip heavy objects with multiple limbs to move them.	
				</p>
				<h3></h3>
				<img src="ConceptAlienTwo.png">				
				<p>
				The second alien design was blocky and rectangular in shape.  Mismatched eyes evoke an otherworldly/monstrous quality and is also very cartoonish. The idea being that the Alien infiltrators have asymmetrical body parts and shapes that would easily make them stand out both from a gameplay perspective and from a design perspective. Being the shortest of the alien infiltrators means he can reach places that the taller aliens would be unable to, such as navigating vents, or hiding under tables, and access items that may otherwise be out of reach for the other characters. He has large ears, which could mechanically function as detection for any pursuing Humans (Such as giving indicators on the player’s screen).	
				</p>
				<h3></h3>
				<img src="ConceptAlienThree.png">				
				<p>
				The final Alien Infiltrator has a bug like appearance. With this character, I thought of having a long-distance psychic alien with the ability to manipulate/levitate/throw objects or to temporarily daze/confuse their victims or pursuers. To visually signal their psychic nature, their eyes are dark with light irises which are archetypal of characters with special powers. They also have a central antenna with three orbs to imply an emitter through which they project their psychic powers. 	
				</p>
				<p>
				A shared theme between the latter two alien characters is the inclusion of at least one antenna, which I thought could act as radio/psychic communication between the different characters (Which could be in-game chat or voice chat) only audible by players.
				</p>	
				<h3></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="year2container">			
				<h3>Human Characters</h3>
				<img src="ConceptHuman.png">					
				<p>
				When deciding how to design the Human characters, the designs align more with the mundane and normal to keep the aliens as absurd and strange. Drawing from familiar archetypes within a job. The Human designs also serve as a visual reference to distinguish the Human body shape from the Alien body shape. As an example, they were designed to be rounder and wider than the aliens. 	
				</p>	
				<h3></h3>
				<img src="ConceptInspector.png">				
				<p>
				One of the focuses for the Humans was a Police Chief/Inspector type of character that acts as the antagonist of the game. They appear in the infiltrated workplace to investigate the activities of the alien infiltrators and exist either as an ever-present obstacle that the Slacker aliens must avoid (Or not act suspicious around so as not to draw attention), or as a stage boss that they must confront. His first outfit would evoke the typical Police Chief/Officer, coming to investigate complaints within the workplace. It is highly recognisable and an immediate sign of trouble for the players to look out for. His second design is much more civilian/plain, which can initially hide the fact that the character is a threat, where he can then reveal that he is an investigator. 	
				</p>
				<h3></h3>
				<p>
				The character is designed to be stocky and proportionally large which would visually contrast them with other smaller Human characters, but especially with the thin/lanky Alien infiltrators. Being bulky would indicate the character’s strength which would be important if the character was a dangerous obstacle but could also indicate that they move slower and could be easy to avoid. His most prominent feature is his monobrow and moustache combination, which he uses to make expressions. Eyes are important for characters to make expression and are typically used to humanise characters and give the audience a level of attachment, so as the antagonist, the Inspector lacks them. However, his exaggerated facial hair and monobrow still allow him to make expressions whilst simultaneously giving him a cartoonish quality, which adds to the comedy.
				<br>
				Client feedback on both the Alien and Human designs was positive. 	
				</p>
				</div>
				<div class="year2container">			
				<h3>Environment</h3>
				<p>
				By understanding what kind of environment these characters would find themselves in, I would get a better idea of how they could fit in and interact with the game world. The environment needed to fit co-operative play, meaning a large space that multiple players could simultaneously interact with and sabotage.	
				</p>
				<h3></h3>
				<p>
				A few settings came to mind: A chemical plant which the aliens would try to sabotage and potentially explode, and a retail shop with a focus on customer interaction with the added chaos of hundreds of interactable shopping items. The idea I settled on was a workplace that plays on the absurd and inefficient sabotage, being a fast-food environment, with the aliens providing poor food services as an attempt to destabilise the local Human food sector. 	
				</p>
				<h3></h3>
				<img src="ConceptRestaurant.png">				
				<p>
				The aliens will purposefully create poor food which gives the Human customers food poisoning but would simultaneously have to serve high-quality food to not rouse the suspicion of the Investigator. Continuing with the theme of the familiar and mundane meets the absurd, the design of the fast-food place internally would exaggerate the typical layout, whilst externally appearing as a simple boxy structure.	
				</p>
				</div>
			<div class="year2container">
			<h1>Iteration & Development</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="year2container">			
			<h3>Refined Character Concepts</h3>			
			<p>
			With the initial concepts created and the general idea of each character’s role defined, I moved on to refining each design. This second batch of concepts were primarily intended to finalise the body shape and colours of the aliens and the inspector, removing any ambiguity from their sketch design by translating it into a pixel art style. As I am more proficient at pixel art, this allowed me to make changes and keep consistency in the art, as well as more easily do poses. Additionally, it allowed me to decide which character would be made into a 3D asset and better inform the creation process rather than having to rely upon the initial sketches.
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<p>
			Each character was given both a front and back profile. To further distinguish the Aliens from each other, they each have been given a unique skin tone and eye colour, each meant to parody the retro sci-fi idea of an alien or creature. These colours help identify the aliens’ roles for players if the initial silhouette (especially for the taller aliens) were confused. The Alien infiltrators are each designed with two varying uniforms: Their undisguised alien outfit, and their infiltration outfit (The uniform of the workplace they are infiltrating). This helps distinguish their initial silhouette as well as providing a modular base from which the aliens may be given new outfits to try on. For their infiltration/disguise outfit, I chose a fast-food uniform to build upon the previously explored fast-food environment. 
			<p>
			<h3></h3>
			<img src="ConceptOctopusAlien.png">				
			<p>
			The first alien character has been re-envisioned to be the Commander of the infiltrators. Now possessing light purplish skin akin to real life octopuses, the colour evokes a softer character who may not be about directly confrontation but also evokes a sense of higher authority due to the imperial connotations of the colour. This authority is further reinforced as seen by the red tag on the front of their undisguised outfit showing rank. Emphasising the octopus design, their hands (which were previously conventional alien hands) are now simply more tendrils. Their tendrils in general are more exaggerated to make their silhouette much more distinguishable than previously. The character was given a new central eye in addition to their four existing eyes to further push their surveillance role. 	
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<img src="ConceptBlockAlien.png">				
			<p>
			The concept for the second Alien infiltrator possessed the most unique silhouette of the three playable characters. The skin colour is meant to echo the classic small grey alien. A unique twist being that, despite its short stature, this alien is far broader than the other, thinner infiltrators, which is meant to communicate a degree of strength. It visually suggests that it would be able to carry heavier or more objects than the other two aliens. Their refined art is unique in that the undisguised uniform is of a janitor, which is to suggest his lower rank, and his role to perform menial tasks. Their fast-food disguise stands out due to several reasons: The full “Slackers” name on their aprons, and the oddly worn employee cap, which could not be placed on the centre of their heads due to their antenna and as a result sits awkwardly at the side. This is a creative use of an otherwise mundane element, as it shows that the Infiltrator is desperately attempting to fit in through any means necessary despite their irregular body shape.	
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<img src="ConceptPsychicAlien.png">				
			<p>
			The final revised playable character is the psychic alien. They are now red with slitted eyes, a choice to show this infiltrator is more hostile compared to the others. Their skin is marked by dark patches, which are meant to demonstrate the effects the use of psychic powers has on their body. Beyond the colouration, the overall design has been retained from the original, except for their eyes now being lower which gives a more apathetic expression, rather than looking almost sad. Like with the octopus alien, the bug alien now possesses a central “eye”. However, instead of acting as a typical eye, this is meant as another indicator of his psychic power which would glow in gameplay to show that the character is using their ability. This character’s disguise uniform is unique in that they are given boots where in their undisguised outfit they lack any shoes. This helps contrast the otherwise apathetic and hostile external appearance by giving something that could be regarded as cute or comedic and keep the character in line with the game’s tone.
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<img src="ConceptRefinedInspector.png">
			<p>
			To better communicate his role as the game’s primary antagonist, the Inspector has seen the most physical change of all the characters. Previously, the Inspector, although meant to be larger than the Aliens, did not look much bigger than the shortest infiltrator, which made him look far less like an active threat. Being a head taller than the tallest alien Infiltrator, the Inspector now stands as the tallest character in Slackers easily making him identifiable amidst other Humans. He has a far stockier build, suggesting that he is very strong and not a character to be taken lightly, and adds an intimidating factor for the players who would have to actively avoid encountering or alerting him. In my original concept, I bounced around this character wearing a Police uniform or a regular civilian outfit, either signalling him as a known threat, or hiding him as an unknown threat. This is now much more explicitly shown, as he wears a beige trenchcoat and a brown fedora, a stereotypical outfit for an inspector, which helps the players identify him immediately as a dangerous obstacle. He retains his signature moustache, monobrow and wide nose combination, which simultaneously are the most important identifying elements of this character, as well as what gives the Inspector a comedic factor for his otherwise intimidating role.
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<img src="ConceptLineUp.png">
			<p>
			Each the characters were drawn in-scale to each other, ensuring a height consistency between them. It also better demonstrates the height difference between the second, blocky infiltrator, explaining their unique ability to traverse otherwise areas unreachable by both the octopus and psychic infiltrators, who stand at a more average Human height. As previously mentioned, it also shows the Inspector physically towering over the other characters, whilst also demonstrating his stocky physique.	
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			</div>
			<div class="year2container">
			<h3>Preparation For 3D</h3>
			<p>
			Before finalising making the refined character concepts, the second, blocky Alien infiltrator was already selected for 3D modelling. Being the most geometric of the three playable characters meant that it would be the straightforward as an initial model and serve as a baseline example for how the project could translate its 2D pixel art into a 3D. The intention is not to copy the concept directly, but to iterate upon the foundations that it sets to best interpret the concept into the 3D space. 	
			</p>							
			<h3></h3>
			<img src="ConceptRefinedAlienTwo.png">			
			<p>
			To prepare it in advance, the refined concept was drawn with both front and back profiles, as well as a side profile, all of which acts as a reference which could be blocked out directly when modelling. This reduces ambiguity regarding the character’s proportions, especially from the side, which in turn eases the translation from pixel art into 3D. 	
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<p>
			Despite the overall visual clarity it provides, the pixel-art concepts still have difficulty communicating certain elements. This is a result of the thick outlines I had chosen to draw the characters, which while allowed me to more easily replicate the sketch designs digitally, are in turn difficult to directly translate into a 3D space, where those outlines would otherwise not exist. This is most evident when trying to translate the beam of the Alien’s antenna into 3D, as it is simply an outline without any primary colours, which as a result made interpretation into 3D while preserving its visual a challenging task.	
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="year2container">			
			<h3>3D Model</h3>
			<p>
			To create the 3D model, I used Blender as the primary modelling software. The character model was created through a box-modelling workflow based on the refined concept sheet. This was done as they are mostly geometric and was deliberately designed as a low-poly character in the concept sheet, meaning that sculpting would only be unnecessary save for any small or smooth details such as hands.	
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<img src="ConceptAlienModelPartOne.png">			
			<p>
			The modelling began with a blocking out phase, where along the largest areas, being the head, the torso and the lower body, leaving space for the legs and arms. The main body was squished slightly, as I had discovered that the body proportions present in the refined concept were over-exaggerated, and would look awkward if translated fully. Once the general shape of the character was completed, the accessories, clothing, and other body parts would be made. This approach is taken to ensure that proportions and shape were resolved before additional details, reducing the need for structural revisions later. 	
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<img src="ConceptAlienModelPartTwo.png">
			<img src="ConceptEar.png">
			<img src="ConceptAlienModelPartThree.png">									
			<p>
			First was the apron. Whilst normally I would make clothing a separate mesh to allow for modularity, this model is only meant to be a visual example of the alien characters and therefore the apron was simply extruded from the body itself. Secondly, the ears and the antenna were created. The ears are simply cone blocks with an indent. While positioning them, they were aligned forward which gives a subtle realistic touch. This was a choice unique to the 3D model as the concept art did not communicate this clearly. The antenna, as discussed previously, was difficult to visually distinguish due to the fact it was only an outline. I decided on retaining the black colouration, which retains visual consistency with the concept, prioritising fidelity over realism which aligns with the tone of the project.	
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<img src="ConceptAlienModelPartFour.png">
			<img src="ConceptAlienModelFront.png">
			<img src="ConceptAlienModelSide.png">											
			<p>
			The model uses simple flat colours rather than complete texture maps, hence the lack of the “Slackers” name on the Alien Infiltrator’s fast-food apron. This is meant to be a temporary measure to show what the partially finished model would look like with the correct colours assigned but is in no part what a complete version of the model would look like.	
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<p>
			One of the last challenges was the alien’s mismatched eyes, as I was unsure whether to give the character geometric eyes in the form of spheres, or to place the eyes on as a texture. Geometric eyes allow for depth and are easy to create. On the other hand, texture eyes would align better with the simplicity of the style and would be easier to customise. Additionally, the basic colours applied on to the geometric eyes looked flat. However, I ultimately decided to go with the geometric eyes for the sake of time.  	
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<p>
			Overall, the model reflects the concept with a clear and readable silhouette. It is exaggerated in a manner evoking the visual silliness outlined by the original project brief. Though the model currently remains unrigged and by extension does not have any animation. For further production purposes, attention would be paid to the connecting joints of the character to ensure smooth animation and clean deformation when fully weight painted. 	
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="year2container">						
			<h3>Core Loop</h3>
			<p>
			The intended core loop would be this: The three alien infiltrators would take the role of average Human employees (Presumably after kidnapping them and stealing their uniforms) and be responsible for disrupting the workplace, adding to a score. While the aliens are deliberately poorly managing the location, the Inspector would arrive part way through to investigate the location and monitor the “employees” for suspicious activity (Adding to a hypothetical “suspicion bar”). He would act as a walking roadblock and occasionally question one of the three Alien infiltrators. If the Inspector is fully suspicious, they would attempt to apprehend the aliens at which point the aliens have to make their escape from the premises. This structure provides an obvious risk-reward loop which encourages players to balance their disruptive infiltration and maintaining plausible deniability around the antagonist.
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<p>
			Within the scope of the project, a completed demo would not be achievable. However, the framework establishes the core gameplay loop, defined roles for the alien infiltrators, demonstrating how they would look in a work environment and their mechanics would function. Additionally, it provides a suitable direction for the project to iterate and expand upon. A limited version of this gameplay demo would place a singular player, as well as the antagonistic Inspector character in a fast-food environment to demonstrate player/NPC interaction and behavioural mechanics. 
			</p>

			<div class="year2container">
			<h1>Sustainability & Ethics</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="year2container">			
			<p>
			Sustainability is an important factor for this project. I personally tend to over-scope my projects beyond my own ability to tackle, and as a result often leave items in an incomplete or unpolished state. Additionally, I often do not approach projects with a concrete plan and resort to retroactively planning around my existing work, which is an unsustainable approach to game development especially when considering deadlines and quotas that must be met. 	
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<p>
			Sustainable Development Goal 12 (The Global Goals, 2025) is concerned with environmental aspects, promoting sustainable consumption and production practices to reduce waste, overproduction and in turn their environmental, social and economic impacts. While typically related to physical, real-world products and waste, SDG 12 also applies to digital production such as Game Development. It introduces restraint within development by encouraging managed scope to avoid feature creep and excessive asset production. Through producing a managed number of reusable assets, it reduces wasted development time, labour, excess storage use, and work on products that may never be shipped. Additionally, it can help put proper focus on a project. By doing this, SDG 12 aims to reduce unsustainable game development practices such as crunch culture.	
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<p>
			SDG 12 aligns with this project especially when considering the limited development time, it could be afforded and lack of specificity within its brief, hence the focus on concept art. This aligns as it functions as a low-cost (both in time and effort) iterative tool through which ideas can be quickly communicated and scope focused. It allows for more decisive decision making by giving out a large variety of ideas which can be sorted through. By doing this, it allows the project to operate on a tighter schedule without wasting development time on excessive or less project relevant items. Platforms such as Trello align well with SDG 12 as they are vital for scope control and reducing overproduction and wasted energy, which in turn reduces burn out as well as crunch. As an example of how concept art has aligned, the initial concepts I created for this project allowed me to expand the core ideas of the game significantly, such as generating a basic gameplay loop.	
			</p>														
			</div>
			<div class="year2container">
			<h1>Reflection & Conclusion</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="year2container">
			<p>
			Slackers has been very valuable in teaching me how to operate independently as an artist, especially how to interpret generalised briefs and create concepts from them, and how to prioritise development to more effectively make use of development time. The experience has revealed to me the difficult challenges one must overcome when operating as a solo designer. Additionally, it has given vital insight into the time constraints involved in client work, not just from the project itself, but also from fitting a project into an existing and busy schedule.	
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<p>
			Despite the precautions undertaken, the project still suffered from a severe degree of over-scoping. This was a result of late iterative work, which meant the final product did not receive a game-ready polish. Therefore, a key focus for game and related projects going forward will be a more rigorous application of the principles of SDG 12 and scope control by limiting the scope to a realistic degree – that being an achievable goal such as a singular highly polished asset or playable prototype. Furthermore, by creating a task hierarchy, it will allow for prioritisation and ultimately polish.	
			</p>
			<h3></h3>
			<p>
			A significant drawback of this project was the lack of clear communication and feedback between artist and client. Communication took place through informal discussions, where feedback was also briefly given. It highlights the importance of establishing clear lines of communication as well as checkpoints and design specifications. This is a key issue that I must learn to tackle as it further reflects the challenges I may face when entering the wider video games industry, especially when pursuing client-based work. For future projects, I will look to introduce structured feedback based to ensure clarity and ensure that the work meets client expectations throughout the development process.	
			</p>			
			<h3></h3>
			<p>
			Although the project did not originally reach a full production stage, it did move past the conceptualisation process by producing a partially completed 3D character model. Alongside this, conceptualisation also produced a viable gameplay loop with a multitude of unique characters. To safeguard future projects, a core focus will be to plan with sustainability in mind by establishing checkpoints to reach. Furthermore, there will be a more active effort to interact with future clients, especially early on to ensure that both parties have clarity and are fully aware of any developments. 
			</p>
