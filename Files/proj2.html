		<h3>Role: Character Designer/Concept Artist</h3>
	</div>
		<div class="textbox">
		<p>Restaurant Brawl is a low-poly singleplayer top-down shooter where the goal is to collect an item in the kitchen of a restaurant, whilst a chef attempts to stop you. Meanwhile, the player would collect food items like burgers as a power-up or to restore lost health. The game was planned with multiple levels, with each increasing in difficulty. For Restaurant Brawl, I prioritised learning how to use modifiers in Blender, mostly the mirror tool.</p>

			<h3>The Concept</h3>
			<p>The original concept of 'Restaurant Brawl' was a topdown shooter set in a church, where the protagonist (presumably a priest) must retrieve an 'artefact' of some sort, guarded by an armoured opponent with a machinegun. The idea was that the opponent was invincible, but could be stunned by shooting at them, and the only way to win the game was to use the artefact to defeat them. Three of the concepts for the artefact (seen below) was a gun, a sword, and a grenade - the latter of which a reference to the holy hand grenade seen in the Monty Python and the Holy Grail movie.</p>

			<h3>The Asset</h3>
			<p>My first asset for the game was a minigun.</p>

			<p>The location would be replaced by a restaurant to fit a 'food theme', wherein the food would serve to give the player health if they were to take damage.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>The Character Designing</h3>
			<p>My biggest challenge in this project was creating a Humanoid figure for both the Enemy and Protagonist. Although I had some experience previously on working with humanoid figures in my own personal projects - I hadn't ever made one from scratch. I would make the base of a Human character model using images of a man as a reference point. I experimented with using the Mirror modifier to hasten the process whilst learning how it worked. However, like the weapon, the model would be left unfinished.</p>

			<h3>The Concept</h3>
			<p>Ultimately, although the model wasn't complete, I would use it as a study on how to use the Subdivision and Solidify Modifiers.</p>
