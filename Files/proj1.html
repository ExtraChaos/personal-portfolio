		<h3>Role: Asset Designer</h3>

	<div class="textbox">
	<p>Sun of a Gun is a side-scrolling Metroidvania-esque game aimed at a mid teen audience. It has a cartoony style similar to that of animal crossing. It is set entirely within a singular tower, which is infested by monsters created by smog and chemicals, with thee primary objective to reach the bottom of the tower and shut it off. To help in this, the player is given the 'Sun-Gun', a solar powered energy weapon to destroy the smog monsters.</p>
	<br>
	<p>As apart of the project, I worked as Asset Designer and responsible for the environment, as well as the monsters. My primary interest was to decorate and beautify the game.</p>

	<h3>Initial Monster Concept</h3>
	<p>The initial concept of the Smog monster was a basic sketch of a two-legged blob with spiked hair, cycloptic eye and ajar mouth. </p>
	<p>This I worked into a side profile to better understand what it could look like. I had initially interpreted the headspikes as being detachable projectiles. However, I decided, as there wasn't much time to animate the creature, I consulted with my fellow designers and decided to simplify the process by having the creature spit projectiles from the mouth instead. This also made the creature more 'mutant' looking.</p>

	<h3>Development of the Idea</h3>

		<img class="secondaryimg" src="monsterconceptcolourideas.png">
	<p>With the ideas trimmed through, I created a basic list of essentials for the monster: the shape had to be consistent, there had to be a crest/head ornament, and there had to be a mouth and eyes. I was unsure at the beginning as to what I could attach on, so for this, I looked to images of cartoony monsters online, especially that of the creatures seen in the movie Monsters Inc.</p>
	<p>I ultimately decided that the original design was good enough, although I would add to it two extra eyes on the side to grant it a more monstrous appearance. In addition to that, I gave the monster purplish skin which I believed made it look more sickly, corrupted and toxic.</p>

	<h3>Finalising the Monster</h3>
	<img class="secondaryimg" src="3dsmoggy.png">
	<p>Finally, to create the monster, I decided to use the free 3D modelling software, Blender, as it provided much more freedom than the restricted Unity engine. The create would be created in three parts: first, a sphere was used and sculpted into the shape of the body and the legs. Then, a cone was created for the head, and mirrored to create its crown. Finally, another two spheres would be made for the eyes and mouth. The process was frustrating at first when trying to learn and understand blender, so I ultimately forgoed the darker splotches and the texturing.</p>
	<img class="secondaryimg" src="smoggy.png">
	<p>Outside of the Monster creation process, I quickly put together some smaller assets like barrels, pipes and vents to create a scene for the creature to stand in.</p>
